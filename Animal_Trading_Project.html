	<p class="animal_description"> The Tyrannosaurus Rex (T-Rex) was one of the most dangerous and feared predators of all time! Roaming the planet around 65 million years ago in what's now known as the USA and Canada, the T-Rex were carnivores, feasting on the flesh of anything unfortunate enough to be caught in it's path. Not only were they one of the most fearsome predators, they were also one of the smartest, boasting a brain twice as big as other giant carnivores. Talk about the total package! Their only flaw was their tiny arms that did not allow them to ever lick their fingers after a meal - KFC would have gotten nowhere with these guys! </p>
